Request you all to follow below while submitting you assignments.

1.	Install GitHub, sign up, create a repository (directory or project) – one per topic is recommended
2.	Invite the trainer of each topic after you submit your assignment, prefer to invite only for the directory / repository wise and not to entire account
3.	Install SourceTree client that will allow you to sync and “push” your assignments’ code onto GitHub repository (directory or project)
4.	While pushing your code follow below process:
a.	Do not just commit your code
b.	Instead, invite the trainer to review it by raising a pull request

If not aware, kindly discover above process (Google, YouTube etc.) yourself.

The reason I am asking you follow GitHub and pull request process is more often than not this process is followed by each client we work with.
And we want to fail fast internally, learn fast… and not fumble in front of our valued customers ??

And above all, GitHub is the most preferred source control and is great to know it upfront.

I will try to stop by in a day or two to oversee this.

Thanks,
Ajay
